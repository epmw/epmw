This folder contains proof of concept implementation of Ergo Wallet functionalities in C hacked during ergo hack vii hackathon. Since it was built during hackathon it utilizes large amount of external libraries since it would be impossible to hack this project in 1.5 day when building everything from scratch. This means this is only "spaghetti code" like implementation to demonstrate how to do it, but should be heavily refactored in the future. Multiple files such as multiple definitions of sha512 hash function are there redundant are there only as side effects of "dependency hell" and no standardized way of libraries managment in C as opposed to languages as python. All of the external libraries contains their corresponding copyright, however many of them were changed a bit or a new functions were integrated into them for the purpose of fullfilment of ergo wallet's requirements.

Code is NOT prone to any SIDE CHANNEL attacks!!!
